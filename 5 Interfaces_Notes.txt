Interface in Java :-
	An interface is a description of the actions that an object can do.
	In Object Oriented Programming, an Interface is usually a set of methods 
	that a object must implement to be of particular type.
	
	For example :
	We have an interface called Vehicle, which has following basic 4 methods.
	Now for any class to be of type Vehicle it must implement the below 4 methods.
	So interface just forces the class implementing it to implement the methods of interface.

Lets take code example :-
		public interface Vehicle{
				boolean start();
				public void drive();
				public void break();
				public double stop();
		}
